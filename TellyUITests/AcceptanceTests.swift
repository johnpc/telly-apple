/// Acceptance runner. The **source of truth is the `.feature` files** under
/// `TellyUITests/Features/`. Each scenario maps to one concrete `test…` method
/// in `AcceptanceTests.generated.swift` (regenerated from the features by
/// `scripts/generate_acceptance_tests.py`). Every generated method delegates to
/// `runScenario(feature:scenario:)` below, which parses that feature at runtime
/// and executes its Given/When/Then steps against the definitions in
/// `StepDefinitions.swift`.
///
/// Why generated concrete methods instead of a fully dynamic suite: XCTest's
/// `-only-testing` filtering and crash-recovery both work by selector name, so
/// real methods are required for CI's targeted retry and for clean crash
/// recovery. The `.feature` files remain the only thing an author edits; the
/// generated file is mechanical and kept in sync by a quality gate.
///
/// Telly is backend-free (no sign-in): scenarios drive the on-device UI
/// directly. On tvOS the same steps run against the focus engine via
/// `XCUIRemote`, dispatched inside `StepDefinitions`.
